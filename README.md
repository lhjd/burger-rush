# Burger Builder Game

A simple web-based game where you build burgers according to orders.

## How to Play

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
2. You'll see an order displayed at the top, showing a stack of ingredients.
3. Click on ingredient buttons to add them to your burger, starting from the bottom (first ingredient) to the top (last ingredient).
4. Once you've added all the ingredients, the game will check if your burger matches the order.
5. Use the "Reset" button to clear your current burger.
6. Use the "New Order" button to get a new random burger order.

## Game Rules

- You must build the burger in the exact order shown, from bottom to top.
- Each burger starts with a bottom bread and ends with a top bread.
- The middle ingredients can be any combination of meat, lettuce, cheese, tomato, and occasionally bread.
